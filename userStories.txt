When the page loads, the user will see a black sudoku board.

Once the user clicks the start button, the board will fill up with numbers and the timer will start to count down

When the user clicks on an empty space, the empty square will be highlighted, as well as the numbers at the bottom of the screen. If the user clicks on the square again, it will be unselected/not highlighted

As long as the square is selected, the user can click on a number from below the board to fill in the empty spot. if the number is correct, the number will appear in black and the square will be unselected. If the number is incorrect, the number will appear in red, and the square will be unselected

If the user would like to take back a move, he/she can click on the undo button, and it will take away the last thing he/she did. If the user wants to get rid of a number that was previously entered, he/she can use the erase button.

The user will be allowed up to 2 mistakes. The third mistake will end the game

If the player wants to put notes into the squares, he/she can click on the notes button, and can input numbers the same way he/she normally would, except the numbers will appear very tiny, and you can also put more than one number in each square. He/she can use the erase button to get rid of the notes, or simply enter a number when not in "notes mode."

Each game will allow for only one hint. When pressed on the button, a random number will appear.

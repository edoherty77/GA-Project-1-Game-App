Start off with the reason why I decided on creating a sudoku app
	I'd take the subway to work for 40 min
	I became good at solving them as I began teaching myself to code
	I thought, why not create one myself, with the features the way I wanted them.

Show the app first, explaining how it works
	Pretty much read your readme while showing the app

Once everyone sees the app, go through the code
Show how I hard coded the answers to a sudoku puzzle
Then show how I created the grid and added the answers to each individual square
Then explain my difficulty functionality which made a certain amount of squares to become empty based on difficulty chosen
	The assign random number function helped with this functionality

Walk through the getSquareValue and getAnswer value functions
	These were created to see if the user was right or wrong with the answer they chose
